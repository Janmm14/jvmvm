This document is the API specification for <a href="http://jauvm.sf.net/">the Jau Virtual Machine</a>.
<p/>
The Jau Virtual Machine (or the JauVM for short) is an implementation of a JVM bytecode interpreter in Java.<br/>
The JauVM does not implement all the features of a standard JVM, since it can rely on the underlying VM for things like
class loading, bytecode verification, garbage collection and heap management.<br/>
The JauVM does however manage its own stack. This will allow the JauVM to provide two popular features the Java
Platform currently lacks: general tail call elimination and serializable continuations.
<p/>
The main class of this framework (and the main class of the executable jar files) is the {@link net.sf.jauvm.Interpreter
Interpreter} class.
